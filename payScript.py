"""
These functions are basically helper functions that are called when somebody makes
a successful payment. 

1st function basically pays every balance, this sets the paymentLastBillingPeriod, 
paymentThisBillingPeriod, and the pendingBalance to 0. the paymentStatus is set to = 'paid'
the account status is set to 'active' and the paidLastMonth is set to 'true'

the 2nd function just pays the paymentLastBillingPeriod setting it to 0 and then minuses the pendingBalance to
paymentLastBillingPeriod (pendingBalance = pendingBalance - paymentLastBillingPeriod)

now everytime this function gets called, it also checks if a particular user has:
paymentThisBillingPeriod, paymentLastBillingPeriod, pendingBalance = 0

if so, then just automatically update their paymentStatus to paid
